## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### Prerequisites

- A Spotify account (any subscription type supported: Premium, Free, Family, Student)
- Spotify API credentials (see below)
- Node.js 18 or newer

### Step 1: Get Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Set the **Redirect URI** to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback`

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback
```

**Note**: You no longer need to manually obtain access tokens! The server will handle the OAuth flow automatically.

### Step 3: Install and Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the server
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start
```

### Step 4: Connect from Your AI Tool

Add this configuration to your MCP-compatible application (example for Cursor):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spotify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tdp2003/spotify-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID": "your-client-id",
        "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret",
        "SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Complete Authorization

1. Call the `get_initial_context` tool in your AI application
2. If not already authorized, you'll receive an authorization URL
3. Open the URL in your browser and log in to Spotify
4. Authorize the application - you'll be redirected automatically
5. Call `get_initial_context` again to confirm the connection

## 👥 User Roles

- **developer**: Full access to all tools and features
- **editor**: Restricted to content-focused tools (no admin features)

Set the role in your MCP client configuration if supported.

---

## 📦 Node.js Environment Setup

If you use a Node version manager (`nvm`, `mise`, `fnm`, etc.), you may need to create symlinks so MCP servers can access Node.js:

```bash
sudo ln -sf "$(which node)" /usr/local/bin/node && sudo ln -sf "$(which npx)" /usr/local/bin/npx
```

Update these symlinks if you change Node versions. Remove them with:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/npx
```

---

## 💻 Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build and run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build the server:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the built server:

```bash
npm start
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector for debugging:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -e SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=... -e SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=... -e SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=... -e SPOTIFY_API_TOKEN=... -e SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=... node path/to/build/index.js
```

This provides a web interface for inspecting and testing the available tools.

## OAuth Flow

The OAuth flow has been improved with the following security and usability enhancements:

### Security Improvements
- **State validation**: Uses cryptographically secure random state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks
- **Redirect URI validation**: Ensures redirect URI uses localhost/127.0.0.1 for automatic token exchange
- **Proper error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all OAuth failure scenarios

### Usability Improvements
- **Automatic browser opening**: Automatically opens the authorization URL in your default browser
- **Better user feedback**: Clear error messages and status updates throughout the process
- **Graceful server shutdown**: Properly closes the OAuth callback server after completion

### Using the OAuth Helper

The `oauth-helper.js` script provides a standalone way to obtain Spotify tokens:

```bash
node src/utils/oauth-helper.js
```

This will:
1. Validate your environment configuration
2. Start a local callback server
3. Automatically open your browser to the Spotify authorization page
4. Handle the callback and exchange the code for tokens
5. Display the tokens for you to add to your `.env` file

### Environment Variables

Make sure your redirect URI is configured correctly:

```env
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8000/callback
```

The redirect URI **must** use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` for the automatic token exchange to work properly.
